# Scribe: back-end-capstone
A nice journalling app I built as my back-end capstone using the MEAN stack. Focuses on user experience, but also displays understanding of the MEAN stack and MVC structure.

User can create an account, password is stored using encryption. User can create a journal entry using a rich text editor, and can assign a tag, entry is stored in the database using Mongo. Upon login, all former journal entries are shown and can be clicked on to view. User can also upload photos to be used as a background, etc.

Technologies used:
mongo, express, angular, node, angular-ui-router, html, css, javascript, bootstrap, jade, sass, gulp, mongoose, npm, bower
