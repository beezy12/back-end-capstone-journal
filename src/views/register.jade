//- after registering, user is redirected to the login page for authentication. I could have all
//- this done on the same page but then I would have to alert the user that either the wrong
//- email address or password has been entered...which is a security risk. You don't ever want
//- anyone to know that they've gotten one of the fields right. So that's why the two auth pages
//- are kept separate.
